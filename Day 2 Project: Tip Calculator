SOLUTION:
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $\n"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?\n "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?\n"))
final_amount = (bill + (tip/100)*bill)/people
print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
